# House Rules
This is a list of rules so we can all get along

## Kitchen
- No dirty dishes in the sink - rinse and put in the dishwasher
- The first person to remove something from the dishwasher should remove **All** the dishes and put then away
- Clean up after cooking

## Bathroom
- This is a septic tank system. Don't put weird stuff down the toilet and try to minimize toilet paper use
- If the TP is low, go get a new roll, and if you use the last square, replace it on the dispenser
- TP rolls go on the roller so the paper runs over the top.
- The toilet lids are **ALWAYS CLOSED** Thank you!
